### Team Work
- Ashedzi did all the work for the header, footer and home page, including making all of those responsive. She was in charge of index.html and home.css  <br /> 
 
- Sarah did the contact-us page as well as combining all of the files, and adjusting some of the class names for redundancy. She was in charge of contact.html, contact-style.css and general-style.css.<br /> 

- Haodi was in charge of the About us section, he wrote about.html and about-style.css 

### Project Features
- Responsive Design: The layout is optimized for different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile) to ensure accessibility and usability across devices.   <br />     

- Simple Navigation: A straightforward navigation system (e.g., a header or menu) to guide users through different sections of the site, such as "Home," "About," or "Contact."<br />    

- GitHub Pages Hosting: The site is hosted on GitHub Pages, indicating it is a static site without server-side processing.
